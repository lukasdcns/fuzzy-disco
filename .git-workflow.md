# Git Commit and Push Workflow

## Rule
After each change or set of related changes, commit the changes and push to origin.

## Workflow
1. After making code changes, run: `git add -A`
2. Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
3. Push to origin: `git push origin master` (or current branch)

## Commit Message Format
- Use clear, descriptive messages
- Reference the feature/task being completed
- Examples:
  - "Add structured items storage in database"
  - "Update VOD route to use items API"
  - "Fix cache extraction logic"

## When to Commit
- After completing a feature or task
- After fixing a bug
- After making significant changes
- At natural breakpoints in development

## Branch
- Default branch: master
- Always push to origin after committing
